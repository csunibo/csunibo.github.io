### [ADMStaff](https://students.cs.unibo.it/)
ADMStaff originated as a group that provides services from students to students. Our goal is to experiment and practice what we are passionate about and curious about. Creating websites, system administration, Infrastructure as a Service, Security, Operating Systems, IoT, 3D printing, and a thousand other things. Everything that sparks curiosity is within our reach.

### [RaspiBO](https://www.raspibo.org/wiki/index.php/Pagina_principale)
RaspiBO is an informal group of electronics and free computer enthusiasts in the Bologna area (but not only). Our skills are diverse; computer science, electronics, mechanics, various arts and crafts: some are experts in their field, some are beginners, but everyone is eager to share their experience.
