For each course, we collect notes, texts, exercise solutions, exam papers,
books, handouts, slides, and much more in an organized manner. Once uploaded,
they become accessible on the following instances:

- [risorse.students.cs.unibo.it](https://risorse.students.cs.unibo.it) (main instance);
- [dynamik.vercel.app](https://dynamik.vercel.app/) (backup instance 1);
- [csunibo.github.io/dynamik](https://csunibo.github.io/dynamik) (backup instance 2).

## Quality Control

When contributing your resources or about to accept someone else's work, make sure:

- not to upload/accept duplicate, incomprehensible, useless, offensive, or illegal content;
- that all [automatic checks](./controlli-automatici) pass;
- to use, where possible, "source" `.tex`/`.md`/`.typ`/`.doc(x)`/`.odt(x)` and similar files instead of their compiled PDF/HTML counterparts (and never unembedded images in other documents);
- to upload, if possible, the resource itself rather than a link to an external version: this way, you enable other people to expand and correct it in the future.
